# Table-Sort-Algorithms-Application
This is a mini-project for the course of "Algorithmic &amp; Complexity" at the First year in Computer Engineering School, in which we choose 3 types of sort algorithm studied in class, and we apply them in a chosen programming language not studied in class -which is Delphi in here- with a GUI.
